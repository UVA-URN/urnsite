            The Outreach Committees main goal is to publicize and carry out the mission of the Undergraduate Research Network to all respective schools and disciplines. The committee is responsible for planning, coordinating, and executing many of the activities for UVA’s annual Research Week. In the past, some of these activities have included workshops, URN’s annual research symposium, fireside chats with faculty and much more. In the future we hope to expand URN’s scope to all fields of study and better inform the study body of our organization’s happenings through the use of the weekly newsletter and social media accounts.

            The Technology Committee works on 3 main parts: UNLEASH, website, and email support. We hope to encourage undergraduate students who are interested in research to get involved and gain their experience as much as possible by publicizing and updating research-related news online. The UNLEASH team handles on the research opportunities available and collaborate closely with officers from the Center of Undergraduate Excellence. The Website team is working on the design, construction, and maintenance of the URN website. The email support team is responsible for the feedback and questions to develop URN from the students and faculties’ perspectives.

            The main goal of the Symposium Committee is to design and organize the Annual Undergraduate Research Symposium. This year, we are partnering with the Office of Undergraduate Research (OUR) to host this event, and our hope is to provide a platform for students to present their research to faculty, peers, and the greater Charlottesville community. Every year, we bring researchers together from a variety of disciplines within the sciences, humanities, arts, and social sciences. In the future, we aspire to continue developing the symposium to fully embody the University of Virginia’s pursuit of discovery and knowledge.

            The Workshops Committee aims to plan and execute workshops and programs that are tailored to students who are seeking to get involved in research, apply to grants, promote their own research, and much more. We target research opportunities in all fields, ranging from sciences to o the arts and humanities. Ranging from career-planning workshops to practical guidance on writing grants and interactions with primary literature, we seek to improve the quality of presentation and involvement in scholarly inquiry at the University. We also hope to offer small travel grants for UVA undergraduate students who hope to attend a workshop or conference outside of the UVA community. Additionally, during Research & Scholarship Week, a week aimed at providing information and opportunities to students as they start a new year, we hold the Research Fair for professors to advertise open positions in their labs.

            The Oculus is UVAs only multidisciplinary undergraduate research journal, We accept content from any field, as long as it is original research. The Oculus is run by its Editorial Board, a committee of 15-20 students who read multiple dynamic and exciting papers every week. These papers are at the forefront of research on Grounds, and represent the best of the new knowledge that is coming to light through the work of undergraduates at UVA. Each one of these submitted papers goes through multiple rounds of eliminations, being read by multiple groups of editors from various disciplines and backgrounds. The Editorial Board then decides which of these papers are of the highest quality, edits them for clarity and conciseness, and compiles these into an annual publication. Once the design has been finalized, this publication is made available before finals begin. We have many great submissions this semester, and our Spring 2018 edition is on track to be a great journal.
